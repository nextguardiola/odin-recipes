            <li>1/2 cup frozen corn, thawed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed</li>
            <li>1/4cup water, divided</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
            <li>3 slices bacon</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons peanut oil</li>
            <li>4 cups cooked medium-grain jasmine rice, cold</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sriracha sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Mix corn, peas, and 1 tablespoon water in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high until tender, about 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk 1 tablespoon water and 1 egg together in a small bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt butter in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Pour in egg; cook until set, about 1 minute per side. Transfer cooked egg into to a plate and slice. Repeat with remaining 2 tablespoons water and remaining 2 eggs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place bacon in the wok and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels and slice.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reheat wok over high heat, about 1 minute. Swirl in oil; heat until it shimmers. Break up large clumps of rice with wet fingers to separate the grains. Add 2 handfuls of rice to the wok and cook, stirring constantly, until it stars to crisp up, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl. Repeat with remaining rice.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce heat to medium; return all rice to the wok. Stir in sriracha sauce, soy sauce, and fish sauce until rice is well-coated and heated through, about 2 minutes. Add corn, peas, eggs, and bacon; toss together until combined, about 3 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
